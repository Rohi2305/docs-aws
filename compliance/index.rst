PCI-DSS
-------

**Is Fanatical Support for AWS PCI-DSS compliant?**

Rackspace is a certified Level 1 Payment Card Industry (PCI) Service Provider
on Fanatical Support for AWS.

**What was the scope of the PCI-DSS assessment?**

For Fanatical Support for AWS, the Rackspace Service Provider assessment
scope is detailed in the Executive Summary document provided to all
customers. This assessment includes tooling and infrastructure operated
by Rackspace and excludes AWS infrastructure, which is covered under
their Report on Compliance.

**Fanatical Support for AWS and related systems and tooling are PCI-DSS
compliant. Does that mean that my solution will be compliant as well?**

Hosting a solution with Rackspace does not make a customer PCI-DSS
compliant. Fanatical Support for AWS Solution Architects are happy to
assist our customers in navigating our product portfolio to identify
solutions which meet their regulatory needs.

**Can Rackspace help my solution become PCI-DSS compliant?**

Rackspace is not a Qualified Security Assessor (QSA) and therefore cannot
give a qualified opinion on the PCI-DSS compliance status of a customer's
solution. In addition, due to many variations in our service delivery
configurations we cannot offer PCI-DSS compliant solutions "out of the box."
However, Rackspace can provide services, products and an extensive partner
network that will satisfy many of the necessary PCI-DSS requirements. For
a detailed list of controls and how Rackspace can assist, please request
the PCI Responsibility Matrix.

**Can Rackspace provide proof of its PCI-DSS compliance?**

Rackspace can provide the following PCI-DSS Compliance Package:

* PCI Responsibility Matrix
* PCI-DSS Report on Compliance Executive Summary
* List of controls that belong to the Service Provider
* The Rackspace Attestation of Compliance

Note: Rackspace cannot release the full PCI-DSS Report on Compliance as
it contains proprietary and commercially sensitive details of Rackspace
security processes.

**How can I get the PCI DSS Compliance Package?**

Customers can access attestation of compliance forms in the Fanatical
Support for AWS control panel: under the account drop-down in the upper
right-hand corner, select "Documents and Forms", and navigate to the
"Rackspace Cloud Security Documents" section.

**Does Fanatical Support for AWS service level matter for PCI-DSS?**

Both our Navigator and Aviator customers can leverage our PCI-compliant
tooling and infrastructure.  Note, however, that the Aviator service
level provides a greater number of value-added services to include
design, service selection, monitoring, and more that make achieving
PCI-DSS compliance easier.

**I have general questions about Rackspace Security beyond the scope
of PCI-DSS - where can I get answers to those questions?**

We have a Rackspace Information Security FAQ which includes additional
information around security policy, internal organization, human
resources, access controls, and more. Similar to the PCI-DSS Compliance
Package, it can be requested from your Fanatical Support for AWS Technical
Account Manager.

HIPAA
-----

**Can Fanatical Support for AWS support HIPAA workloads?**

Yes, Rackspace can act as a business associate to support customers with
HIPAA workloads at AWS.

**Why is it important to have a Managed Service Provider (MSP) who can
manage workloads on top of AWS if AWS already provides HIPAA-eligible
services?**

Any business that has needs to store, process, or transmit HIPAA data
needs to ensure that the Managed Service Provider they choose on top of
AWS has practices in place to allow them to comply with HIPAA, as well as a
signed BAA (Business Associate Agreement).

**Does Fanatical Support for AWS service level matter for HIPAA?**

We provide management for both Navigator and Aviator customers running
HIPAA workloads at AWS. However, with Aviator service level customers can
take advantage of value-add services like best-practice architecture, service
selection, patching, monitoring, and ongoing operations that may make
achieving HIPAA compliance easier for customers.

**Do I need to maintain a Business Associate Agreement (BAA) with both
Rackspace and AWS?**

For the AWS accounts that Rackspace supports, you only need to sign a BAA
with Rackspace.

**How can I get a copy of the Fanatical Support for AWS BAA?**

Please get in touch with your Fanatical Support for AWS Technical Account
Manager (TAM) or Rackspace Sales Representative who can get you a copy
of the Fanatical Support for AWS BAA.
