.. Define |product name| in conf.py

Document any troubleshooting steps for common issues related to the product
or service described in the guide. Troubleshooting information typically
describes an issue, its symptoms, the environment, and the possible causes,
and provides suggestions for recovering. As such, a troubleshooting topic
can contain almost any structure, from paragraphs, bullet lists, and numbered
lists, to sections, tables, and figures.

If you have many troubleshooting tips, create separate sections with
descriptive headings. You can also create separate child files under a parent
“Troubleshooting” topic.

Following is an example introductory sentence:

If you encounter issues when working with |product name|, use the information
in this section to help you troubleshoot.
