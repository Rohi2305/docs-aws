If you need Fanatical Support for your AWS accounts, a helpful Racker is
always just a phone call or ticket away. We are available live 24x7x365.

Tickets
-------

One of the primary ways to interact with a Racker is by creating
a ticket in the
`Rackspace Technology Customer Portal <https://manage.rackspace.com/aws>`_.
After you log in, click **Support** in the top navigation bar and
follow the links to create a new ticket or view an existing ticket.

Our automated systems create tickets for events on your AWS accounts
that require attention from you or a Racker. For example,
our :ref:`Rackspace Watchman <watchman>` creates a ticket when the
system raises an alarm that requires attention.

When we update a ticket, you get an email directing you back
to the Control Portal to view the latest comments.
