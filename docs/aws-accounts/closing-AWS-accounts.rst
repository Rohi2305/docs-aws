**Before Closing an Account - Things to do and considerations**

Please review the product terms within your Rackspace contract to understand what notice is required before we will close an AWS account on your behalf. 

Back up any resources or data that you want to keep. Transfer data from Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) or Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) using AWS Transfer Family. Find all your active resources and terminate to stop incurring billing for the AWS services. 
If you purchased subscriptions with ongoing payment commitments, then you're charged for these subscriptions until the plan term ends even after you close your account. This applies to subscriptions such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) Reserved Instances (RIs) and Savings Plans.


**After Closing an Account**

After 90 days, any content remaining in your account will be permanently deleted, and AWS services that aren't already terminated also will be terminated. However, service attributes might be retained as long as necessary for billing and administration purposes. AWS retains your account information as described in the Privacy Notice. You can't permanently delete your account before 90 days. You can't reopen the account after 90 days.

You can't create new AWS accounts using the email address that was associated with your account at the time of its closure.
