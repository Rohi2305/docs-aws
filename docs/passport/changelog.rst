Changelog
=========

2022-10-07
----------

Version: `1.0.0`

Moving to Semantic Versioning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All CLI releases beginning with 1.0.0 will follow semantic versioning.

Support for Active Directory Domain Controllers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Passport now support connecting to domain controllers. In order to support this change, we have changed the format of the Rackspace usernames generated by Passport to avoid collisions when accessing multiple domain controllers at the same time:

  Old Format: `racker-<masked-id>`
  New Format (Non-Domain Controller): `rs-<masked-id>`
  New Format (Domain Controller): `rs-<masked-id>-<random-suffix>`

Version: `5bba0a79`

Support for SHA-2 Certificate Signing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Previous version of Passport always signed SSH keys using the SHA-1 algorithm.
Newer OSes, including Ubuntu 20, are now shipping openssh 8.2. openssh 8.2+
drops support for SHA-1 certificates. Starting with this version of Passport,
Passport will always generate both SHA-1 and SHA-2 certificates and attempt to
authenticate with both versions. This allows Passport to work for older OSes
that only support SHA-1 as well as newer OSes that only support SHA-2.
