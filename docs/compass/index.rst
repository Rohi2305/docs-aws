Compass
=======

|CompassTM| is a set of tools that help you understand several dimensions of
your AWS account(s). We perform an automated analysis of control plane
(e.g. data visible through the AWS APIs) details to provide a thorough
look at opportunities to improve the cost, reliability, redundancy, and
security of your environment. We also present robust inventory information
that provides an at-a-glance view of what resources you are running across
all AWS public regions.

For Navigator accounts, our AWS experts are available to provide support
and guidance on Compass recommendations. For Aviator accounts, our
Fanatical Support for AWS support teams will work with you to proactively
execute on Compass recommendations to help reduce AWS spend, improve your
security posture, and implement other optimizations.

You can access Compass by clicking the Compass link in the
`Fanatical Support for AWS Control Panel <https://manage.rackspace.com/aws>`_.

includes aggregated data about all of your AWS accounts.
