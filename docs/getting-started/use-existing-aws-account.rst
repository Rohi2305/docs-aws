===========================
Use an existing AWS account
===========================

Our general recommendation is to create a new AWS account as it will be
provisioned immediately and will already include all of our best
practice configuration ready for you to use. If you have an existing
AWS account that you would like to use with our services, please see
:ref:`Transferring Existing AWS Accounts to Rackspace <transferring-existing-aws-accounts>`
for additional details regarding the process.
