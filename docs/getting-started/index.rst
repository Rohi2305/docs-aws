Getting started
===============

It is extremely easy to get started experiencing Fanatical Support for AWS.

.. _create_rackspace_account:

Create your Rackspace account
-----------------------------

The first step is to create your Rackspace account. Visit
`https://cart.rackspace.com/aws <https://cart.rackspace.com/aws>`_
and follow the instructions to establish your account.

.. _add_aws_account:

Add a new AWS account
---------------------

Once you have created your Rackspace account navigate to the
`Fanatical Support for AWS Control Panel <https://manage.rackspace.com/aws>`_.
Login using the credentials you established during the signup process above.

Note that all new Rackspace accounts undergo a thorough review to minimize
fraud. This process can take several minutes to several hours to
complete, depending on the details of your signup. You will not be able to
proceed until the verification is complete. If you would like to expedite
the verification process, please :ref:`Contact Us <support>`.

Once you are logged in you will see an option to add a new AWS account.
Provide the relevant details and select a
:ref:`service level <service_levels>`. We will immediately provision
you with a new AWS account ready for your use. You can click the
"Log in to AWS Console" link to go straight to AWS, though we encourage
you to first review our :ref:`recommended_network_configuration`.

If at any time you need assistance from a Racker, please do not hesitate
to :ref:`Contact Us <support>`.


.. _use_existing_aws_account:

Use an existing AWS account
---------------------------

Our general recommendation is to create a new AWS account as it will be
provisioned immediately and will already include all of our best
practice configuration ready for you to use. If you have an existing
AWS account that you would like to use with our services, please see
:ref:`transferring_existing_aws_accounts`
for additional details regarding the process.
