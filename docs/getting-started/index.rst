It is extremely easy to start experiencing Fanatical Support for AWS.

.. _create_rackspace_account:

Create your Rackspace account
-----------------------------

The first step is to create your Rackspace account. Visit
`https://cart.rackspace.com/aws <https://cart.rackspace.com/aws>`_
and follow the instructions to establish your account.

.. _add_aws_account:

Add a new AWS account
---------------------

After you have created your Rackspace account navigate to the
`Rackspace Technology Customer Portal <https://manage.rackspace.com/aws>`_.
Log in by using the credentials you established during the preceding signup process.

**Note**: All new Rackspace accounts undergo a thorough review to minimize
fraud. This process can take several minutes to several hours to
complete, depending on your signup details. You cannot
proceed until the verification completes. If you want to expedite
the verification process, :ref:`Contact Us <support>`.

After you log in, you see an option to add a new AWS account.
Provide the relevant details and select a
:ref:`service level <service_levels>`. At that point, we immediately provision
a new AWS account ready for your use. You can click the
**Log in to AWS Console** link to go straight to AWS, though we encourage
you to first review our :ref:`recommended_network_configuration`.

Any time you need assistance from a Racker, do not hesitate
to :ref:`Contact Us <support>`.


.. _use_existing_aws_account:

Use an existing AWS account
---------------------------

Generally, we recommend that you create a new AWS account because we
provision it immediately and already include all of our best-practice
configurations ready for your use. If you have an existing
AWS account that you want to use with our services, see
:ref:`transferring_existing_aws_accounts`
for additional details regarding the process.
