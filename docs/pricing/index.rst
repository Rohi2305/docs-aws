Pricing

Your monthly service fees will be calculated by pooling the AWS infrastructure
charges from all of your AWS accounts. Learn more about monthly service fee
calculations in the :ref:`Billing <billing_monthly_service_fees>` section.

Service fees are charged in addition to AWS infrastructure rates. Service
Fees for AWS Reserved Instances and Spot Instances are calculated based on
the corresponding on-demand list rates. AWS infrastructure is charged at the
list rates on the `AWS website <https://aws.amazon.com>`_. You can view your
service fees in the
`Fanatical Support for AWS Control Panel <https://manage.rackspace.com/aws/pricing>`_.

Please note that the AWS free tier is not available to Fanatical Support
for AWS accounts.
