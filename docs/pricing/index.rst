Pricing

We calculate your monthly service fees by pooling the AWS infrastructure
charges from all of your AWS accounts. Learn more about monthly service fee
calculations in the :ref:`Billing <billing_monthly_service_fees>` section.

We charge service fees in addition to AWS infrastructure rates. We calculate
service fees for AWS Reserved Instances and Spot Instances based on
the corresponding on-demand list rates. We bill AWS infrastructure at the
list rates on the `AWS website <https://aws.amazon.com>`_. You can view your
service fees in the
`Rackspace Technology Customer Portal <https://manage.rackspace.com/aws/pricing>`_.

**Note**: The AWS free tier is not available to Fanatical Support
for AWS accounts.
