You can purchase items in a matter of minutes from the AWS Marketplace
for use in your AWS account.  Note that Rackspace bills you for any
purchases from the AWS Marketplace along with your AWS infrastructure and
Rackspace management fees on your monthly invoice.  Additionally, we
treat any purchases from the AWS Marketplace as AWS infrastructure when
we calculate the Rackspace management fees.
