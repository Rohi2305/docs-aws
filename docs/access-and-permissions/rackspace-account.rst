Rackspace Account
=================

Your Rackspace account is the top-level container which contains one or
more AWS accounts. All user and permissions management takes place at the
Rackspace account level, though you can limit specific users on your
account to only have access to specific AWS accounts. The Rackspace account
is also used for billing purposes. All charges from each of the AWS
accounts are
:ref:`aggregated at the Rackspace account level <billing_rackspace_account>`.

The Account Owner or a user with the Account Administrator designation can
set the session inactivity timeout for the
`Fanatical Support for AWS Control Panel <https://manage.rackspace.com/aws>`_.
To change the timeout, visit
`account.rackspace.com <https://account.rackspace.com>`_, and then navigate
to Account Settings > Rackspace Account Settings > Session Inactivity Timeout.
The session inactivity timeout is the maximum time a user can be inactive
before being automatically logged out. This timeout is applied to all users
on the account.
